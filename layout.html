    <p>Here is the physical layout of Purple Tentacle, with various key groups
highlighted.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/02-layout/layout.png" /></p>
<p>The main area is split into two halves, with a fixed 26° angle between
them. (This provides the ergonomic advantages of a split keyboard
while keeping the case design easy and without having to invent a way
to interconnect the halves.)</p>
<p>Keys in the main area are arranged in straight columns, which are
staggered in accordance with finger lengths.</p>
<p>There are eight columns in each half; the home position spans four
columns in the middle. Two additional outside columns are provided for
the pinky, and two inside columns for the index finger. (This is in
contrast to the conventional non-split layout, which has only two
inside columns, one outside column on the left and three to four
outside columns on the right, overworking the right pinky.)</p>
<p>It is suggested that the most frequently used editing keys —
<kbd>Backspace</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd>, and
<kbd>Delete</kbd> — be moved to the inside columns, and some of the
punctuation keys in the outside columns be moved to the left hand.</p>
<p>This leaves several spare keys for user experimentation. Use these
for anything you can think of. Ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any classic keys you need (<kbd>Print Screen</kbd>, <kbd>Scroll
  Lock</kbd>, <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>, or <kbd>Win</kbd>)</li>
<li><kbd>Undo</kbd>, <kbd>Cut</kbd>, <kbd>Copy</kbd> and
  <kbd>Paste</kbd> down the leftmost column</li>
<li>The ISO backslash key</li>
<li>Additional input method-specific keys for East Asian languages</li>
<li>Macros</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart for the main area, the layout includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function keys on the top, in groups of four. (This grouping aids in
  finding them by touch.)</li>
<li>Two diamond-shape navigation clusters, positioned in the
  index–middle–ring finger columns and accessible without moving the
  wrist.</li>
<li>Three keys for each thumb and two keys to be pressed with the base
  of the thumbs. The arrangement suggested on the image above makes it
  possible to press two modifiers simultaneously with one thumb while
  leaving the other fingers in their home position.</li>
</ul>
<p>The triangular shape in the middle, highlighted in purple, with the
green status LEDs, resembles a character from Day of the Tentacle, a
1993 video game. This is what the keyboard is named after.
