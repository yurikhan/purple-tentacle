    <p>Here is the physical layout of Purple Tentacle,
with various key groups highlighted.
The default keymap is shown;
you will be able to customize it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0eb51054919d0ed51396cbd71c97c7d0"><img alt="" src="./images/02-layout/layout.png" /></a></p>
<p>(Forking note:
the Corresponding Source for this image
is available <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0eb51054919d0ed51396cbd71c97c7d0">online</a>.)</p>
<p>The main area is split into two halves,
with a fixed 26° angle between them.
(This provides the ergonomic advantages
of a split keyboard
while keeping the case design simple.)</p>
<p>Keys in the main area are arranged in straight columns,
which are staggered in accordance with finger lengths.</p>
<p>There are eight columns in each half;
the home position spans four columns in the middle.
Two additional outside columns are provided for the pinky,
and two inside columns for the index finger.
(This is in contrast
to the conventional non-split layout,
which has only two inside columns,
one outside column on the left
and three to four outside columns on the right,
overworking the right pinky.)</p>
<p>The default keymap
moves the most frequently used editing keys —
<kbd>Backspace</kbd>,
<kbd>Enter</kbd>,
<kbd>Tab</kbd>,
and <kbd>Delete</kbd>
(highlighted in yellow) — to the inside columns,
and duplicates one punctuation key
(US <kbd>\|</kbd>, or UK <kbd>#~</kbd>)
on the left hand.</p>
<p>This leaves several spare keys for user experimentation
(highlighted in red).
The default keymap assigns them
in a way that tries to accommodate most national layouts
out of the box.
However, if you create a keymap
that is substantially better
for a particular language,
please <a href="https://github.com/yurikhan/purple-tentacle/pulls">send a pull request</a>!</p>
<p>Apart for the main area,
the layout includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function keys on the top,
  in groups of four
  (highlighted in purple).
  This grouping aids in finding them by touch.</li>
<li>Two diamond-shape navigation clusters,
  positioned in the index–middle–ring finger columns
  and accessible without moving the wrist
  (highlighted in blue).</li>
<li>Three keys for each thumb
  and two keys to be pressed with the base of the thumbs
  (highlighted in green).
  Arranging modifiers as shown above
  makes it possible to press two modifiers
  simultaneously with one thumb
  while leaving the other fingers in their home position.</li>
</ul>
<p>The triangular shape in the middle,
highlighted in purple,
with the green status LEDs,
resembles a character from Day of the Tentacle,
a 1993 video game.
This is what the keyboard is named after.
