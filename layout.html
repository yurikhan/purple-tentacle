    <p>Here is the overall layout of Purple Tentacle, with various key groups
highlighted.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/02-layout/layout.png" /></p>
<p>On the top edge, you have the classic row of function keys, in groups
of four.</p>
<p>The main area is split into two halves, with a fixed 26° angle between
them. (This provides the ergonomic advantages of a split keyboard
while keeping the case design easy and without having to invent a way
to interconnect the halves.)</p>
<p>The layout features navigation keys, arranged in diamond shapes and
positioned in the index–middle–ring finger columns. They are easily
accessible without moving the wrist.</p>
<p>Each half has three thumb keys and one key for the base of the thumb.
The <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> arrangement
makes it possible to press two modifiers simultaneously with one thumb
while leaving the other fingers in their home position.</p>
<p>The additional column of keys in the middle, pressed by the index
fingers, accommodates the most frequently used editing keys:
<kbd>Backspace</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd>,
<kbd>Delete</kbd>, and more rare but still occasionally useful
<kbd>Insert</kbd> and <kbd>Menu</kbd> keys.</p>
<p>Holding down the left Space (<kbd>Fn</kbd>) key turns the right half
into a keypad. Note that the home row corresponds to digits 4, 5, and
6, the same as on a real keypad. Pressing <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Keypad
Lock</kbd> locks this mode, for the rare case when you need to enter a
bunch of numbers without needing any letters.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are several spare keys for experimentation. Use these
for anything you can think of. Ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any classic keys you need (<kbd>Print Screen</kbd>, <kbd>Scroll
  Lock</kbd>, <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>, or <kbd>Win</kbd>)</li>
<li><kbd>Undo</kbd>, <kbd>Cut</kbd>, <kbd>Copy</kbd> and
  <kbd>Paste</kbd> down the leftmost column</li>
<li>The ISO backslash key</li>
<li>Additional input method-specific keys for East Asian languages</li>
<li>Macros</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, thanks to the TMK Keyboard Firmware, all keys are
customizable. All of the above is only a recommendation.</p>
<p>The triangular shape in the middle, highlighted in purple, with the
green status LEDs, resembles a character from Day of the Tentacle, a
1993 video game. This is what the keyboard is named after.
