Summary: Purple Tentacle is a simple ergonomic desktop computer keyboard.

[TODO: put a finished product photo here.]

In a nutshell, Purple Tentacle is a
DIY
flat
one-piece
fixed split
ergonomic
mechanical
computer keyboard
for use with a desktop computer.

It pursues two goals:

* **Be simple to design and build.**
  You need to
  have access to a laser cutting facility
  and be able to solder,
  but that is pretty much it.

* **Be reasonably comfortable to use.**
  The computer keyboard as we know it today
  has evolved from a typewriter keyboard.
  Features were added
  while preserving backward compatibility.
  Some of the constraints underlying the designs
  are no longer relevant.

Minimalism is explicitly *not* a goal.
This is a desktop computer keyboard.
Itâ€™s not sacrificing functionality
in an attempt to make it easier
to carry around with you all the time.
