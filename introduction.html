<p>In a nutshell, Purple Tentacle is a DIY flat one-piece fixed split
ergonomic mechanical computer keyboard for use with a desktop
computer.</p>
<p>It pursues two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be simple to design and build.</strong> You need to have access to a
  laser cutting facility and be able to solder, but that is pretty
  much it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be reasonably comfortable to use.</strong> The computer keyboard as
  we know it today has evolved from a typewriter keyboard. Features
  were added while preserving backward compatibility. Some of the
  constraints underlying the designs are no longer relevant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimalism is explicitly <em>not</em> a goal. This is a desktop computer
keyboard. It’s not sacrificing functionality in an attempt to make it
easier to carry around with you all the time.</p>
