<h2 id="key-switches">Key switches</h2>
<p>Purple Tentacle is designed around Matias key switches.
A Cherry MX-based variant is possible but many adjustments will be
required (different cutout size, different plate thickness, possibly
different frame thickness).</p>
<p>Matias switches come in three variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quiet Click (PG155B01 or KS101Q)</li>
<li>Click (PG155B02 or KS101)</li>
<li>Quiet Linear (KS102Q)</li>
</ul>
<p>They are sold in boxes of 200, at $50 a box.</p>
<p>If unsure, choose Quiet Click.</p>
<h2 id="keycaps">Keycaps</h2>
<p>Matias keycaps are available in black or white; blank or labeled. They
are made of ABS plastic, have matte cylindrical surface, and differ by
row.</p>
<p>When choosing, keep in mind the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blank sets offered by the Matias Corporation directly have more
  keycaps than any of the labeled sets.</li>
<li>The blank sets sold by The Keyboard Company, on the other hand,
  might not. Read the description carefully.</li>
<li>Labeled sets are tailored to the conventional keyboard layout. You
  will be able to put a cap on each key, but not all labels will make
  sense. For example, no set offers a single-unit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  keycap.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://pimpmykeyboard.com/">Signature Plastics</a> offers a limited selection of keycaps with
Alps mounts; these are blank only, more expensive, and in various
colors and profiles.</p>
<p>There is no default for the keycaps; you have to make this choice.</p>
<h2 id="palm-supports">Palm supports</h2>
<p>Purple Tentacle uses palm supports designed for the Matias Ergo Pro
keyboard. These come in five colors: White, Black, Red, Navy Blue, and
Astronaut Blue. They are gel pads covered with silk, attached to a
plastic/steel base.</p>
<p>Whether to use palm supports is a personal choice, dependent on your
typing habits.</p>
<p>If you do use the palm supports, they will accumulate lint from your
palms. Once in a while, detach them and hand-wash with soap. Do not
put in a washing machine! Dishwasher compatibility not tested.</p>
<h2 id="controller-board">Controller board</h2>
<p>For the controller, choose an Atmel ATmega32u4-based breakout board
which exposes at least 23 I/O pins, is wired for 5 V, and is
sufficiently small (≈50×20 mm or so). Possibilities include (but are
not necessarily limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardMicro">Arduino Micro</a> or clone</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/296">Adafruit Atmega32u4 Breakout Board</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/3102">Pololu A-Star 32U4 Mini</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html">PJRC Teensy 2.0</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These boards do <em>not</em> expose enough pins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pololu A-Star 32U4 Micro (18 pins)</li>
<li>SparkFun Pro Micro (18 pins)</li>
</ul>
<p>This instruction assumes Arduino Micro. For other boards, minor
adjustments to wiring and/or firmware may be needed.</p>
<p>Note that some boards will not advertise their total pin number. For
example, Arduino Micro advertises 20. For best results, check the
schematic and count I/O pins which have no other components attached.</p>
<p>If the board has a pin that only drives a general-purpose LED, count
it also; use it for one of the keyboard status LEDs. (This way you get
useful feedback when the bootloader flashes this LED.) Avoid pins that
drive fixed-purpose LEDs such as RXLED and TXLED.</p>
<p>Given a choice, prefer boards that come <em>without</em> solderless
breadboard pins attached — they won’t fit in the keyboard case and
you’ll have to desolder them.</p>
<h2 id="cable">Cable</h2>
<p>Choose a cable so that one end fits the controller board (either mini
or micro USB B male connector) and the other end has a standard USB A
male connector. Choose a length that fits your working environment.
Avoid ferrite rings and L-shaped connectors as they will be a hassle
to fit in the keyboard case.</p>
<h2 id="diodes">Diodes</h2>
<p>To prevent ghosting, a diode is installed in series with each key
switch.</p>
<p>This instruction assumes 1N4148 diodes.</p>
<h2 id="status-leds">Status LEDs</h2>
<p>For status indicators (Num Lock, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock), choose LEDs
that will fit in 8 mm space and have forward voltage of 3 V or less.
Prefer diffused ones. Choose through-hole mount, not surface mount.</p>
<p>This instruction assumes ⌀3 mm green LEDs, forward voltage 1.8–2 V,
maximum current 20 mA.</p>
<h2 id="limiting-resistors">Limiting resistors</h2>
<p>Calculate the minimum limiting resistor value as
<var>R</var><sub>min</sub> = (<var>V</var><sub>cc</sub> −
<var>V</var><sub>f</sub>) / <var>I</var><sub>max</sub>, where
<var>V</var><sub>cc</sub> = 5 V, <var>V</var><sub>f</sub> is the LED
forward voltage, and <var>I</var><sub>max</sub> is the LED maximum
current, and use an actual value above that in order to keep the
current through LEDs within specifications.</p>
<p>For best results, try resistors of several values and choose the one
that yields the most comfortable LED brightness. Your goal is to make
the LED noticeable but not painful to look at. Be sure to test both in
bright daylight and in dim lighting.</p>
<p>For example, for the LEDs specified above the formula gives a minimum
resistance of 150 Ω, but a 1 kΩ value gives a more pleasant
brightness.</p>
<h2 id="mounting-plate">Mounting plate</h2>
<p>Matias switches are mounted on a plate 1 mm thick. Ask your laser
cutting facility what materials they carry.</p>
<p>If in doubt, choose stainless steel. (If you make a Purple Tentacle
with a plate made of a different material, please
<a href="https://github.com/yurikhan/purple-tentacle/issues/1">share your experience</a>!)</p>
<h2 id="bottom-plate">Bottom plate</h2>
<p>The bottom plate covers the electronics from below. If you choose to
use palm supports, the bottom plate is what they attach to.</p>
<p>This instruction assumes 1 mm stainless steel, same as the mounting
plate.</p>
<h2 id="spacer">Spacer</h2>
<p>The spacer is the layer of the case between the bottom plate and the
mounting plate. It provides outer walls for the internal cavity that
houses the electronics.</p>
<p>This layer must be at least 9 mm thick. When key switches are inserted
into the mounting plate, their pin ends will go 8 mm below the plate
level, and you will need a little space so that the bottom plate does
not touch them.</p>
<p>Ask your laser cutter facility what materials they carry and what they
work with. If they don’t have anything suitable, ask what size the
raws need to be.</p>
<p>The choice is purely aesthetical.</p>
<p>With translucent plastics, electronics next to the edges will be
visible through the case walls. Also, if your controller board has an
always-on power LED, it will shine through the back.</p>
<p>This instruction assumes 10 mm clear acrylic.</p>
<h2 id="top-frame">Top frame</h2>
<p>The top frame provides walls around the keycaps. It is optional if you
do not have kids or pet cats. If you do, a frame is highly
recommended; otherwise you may find these can spuriously act as poorly
controlled keycap pullers.</p>
<p>The distance from the mounting plate to the bottom edge of keycaps is
8 mm. On the other end, experience shows that a 10 mm frame makes it
difficult to press the thumb base keys. Therefore, 8 mm thickness is
recommended.</p>
<p>The choice of material is mostly aesthetical. If it is opaque, you
will need holes for the status LEDs.</p>
<p>This instruction assumes 8 mm clear acrylic.</p>
<h2 id="wire">Wire</h2>
<p>Purple Tentacle does not use a PCB; instead, it is hand-wired. There
are a couple of reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>When building a single unit or two, manufacturing a board is more
  hassle than hand-wiring.</li>
<li>Given that switches are inserted into the mounting plate from above,
  soldering them to a PCB below will make it almost impossible to
  replace a faulty switch without desoldering the whole board. Faulty
  switches <em>do</em> happen, and you will discover them only after
  finishing assembly and typing for a few hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix rows are wired with diode pins; for everything else you need
wire. If you have soldering experience, use whichever wire is
convenient for you. If not, choose solid core copper wire, around
AWG 26 (0.13 mm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Category 5 twisted pair can be used if that’s what you have handy. It
provides convenient color coding for the wires, although it is a bit
too rigid. If you go this way, you need 1.5 m 4-pair UTP or 3 m 2-pair
UTP.</p>
<h2 id="m3-bolts-and-nuts">M3 bolts and nuts</h2>
<p>M3 bolts and acorn nuts screw the case details together. Washers
protect the top frame against excessive pressure from the nuts.</p>
<p>Choose a bolt length that is 2 to 4 mm longer than the total thickness
of the bottom, spacer, plate, and frame (if used). Add washers if
needed. (The M3 acorn nut has a depth of 4.5 mm.)</p>
<p>For example: 1 mm bottom + 10 mm spacer + 1 mm plate + 8 mm frame =
20 mm. The next standard screw length is 25 mm, which is a bit too
long. The standard M3 washer is 0.5 mm so we add two of them.</p>
<p>Choose a head shape with a flat underside, not a countersunk one.</p>
<h2 id="m6-bolts-and-nuts">M6 bolts and nuts</h2>
<p>M6 bolts, washers and nuts are used to attach palm supports. If
you don’t want palm supports, you can skip these.</p>
<p>The palm supports provide an elevation of ≈8 mm to the front edge of
the keyboard. This should accommodate most M6 bolt heads so they won’t
scratch your desk.</p>
<p>Choose a head shape with a flat underside, not a countersunk one.</p>
<h2 id="rubber-feet">Rubber feet</h2>
<p>Rubber feet prevent the keyboard from moving on your desk.
Additionally, they prevent the case bolt heads from scratching the
desk surface.</p>
<p>Choose feet thickness so that it exceeds the bolt head height. 4 mm or
higher should accommodate most standard shapes of M3 bolt heads.</p>
<p>With palm supports, two rubber feet are sufficient. Without palm
supports, you might want five.</p>
<p>The best-known supplier is 3M. Suitable feet are sometimes bundled
with network appliances such as switches, home routers, and WiFi
access points.</p>
